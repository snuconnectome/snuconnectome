## 7. Timeline & Next Steps
1. **Week of Nov 3, 2025:** Submit RFP to Park Hyatt Busan (rooms + Salon + dinner packages). Include academic tax exemption status if applicable.
2. **Week of Nov 10:** Compare proposal vs. Hakone options; confirm budget ceiling with finance.
3. **By Nov 17:** Place tentative hold on 5 rooms + Salon; request draft banquet order for Dining Room & anniversary add-on.
4. **By Nov 24:** Finalize transport vendor and contingency activity (e.g., guided Dongbaek walk, BEXCO tour).
5. **Dec 2025:** Share travel briefs with faculty; note local events (Busan One Asia Festival June, but monitor for Jan conventions).
6. **Jan 2026:** Reconfirm weather plans (indoor lounge backup) and dietary needs.

## 8. Decision Lens Checklist
- **Academic fit:** Are small-group salons adequate vs. Hakone’s intimate setting?
- **Travel effort:** Evaluate long-haul vs. domestic; ensure professor buy-in for coastal winter climate.
- **Budget delta:** Busan scenario currently ~₩1.28M pp (excluding meeting rental), notably lower than Hakone Retreat Före (~₩1.46M pp) while offering more urban dining options.
