## Venue Recommendations

### Option 1: Hakone Retreat Före (Primary Recommendation)

**Concept: A Modern Retreat for Renewal and Focus**

Hakone Retreat Före is a 4-star boutique hotel renowned for its serene, Scandinavian-inspired design and tranquil forest setting. It is the ideal choice for a true retreat, where the primary goal is to escape the everyday, foster deep thinking, and strengthen interpersonal connections. The environment is intentionally crafted for relaxation and wellness, featuring premium spa and onsen facilities. Its acclaimed restaurant, "Free Bird," offers a 6-course kaiseki dinner that promises a memorable culinary experience.

While the investment is higher, it reflects a commitment to providing a truly exceptional and private experience that prioritizes comfort, style, and well-being.

*   **Meeting Facilities:** A private meeting space is available for exclusive use by lodging guests, perfectly suited for focused discussions for the 10-person group.
*   **Estimated Budget:** **₩14,570,000** (approximately ₩1,457,000 per person for 3 days/2 nights).

### Option 2: Hotel Kajikaso (Alternative Recommendation)

**Concept: A Traditional Venue for Productive Meetings**

Hotel Kajikaso is a highly-regarded traditional Japanese ryokan that excels in hosting professional groups and events. It represents a more conventional, yet highly effective, choice for a workshop where formal meetings are the central focus. The hotel boasts four dedicated conference rooms equipped with comprehensive AV systems, ensuring a seamless and productive meeting experience. Its convenient location near Hakone-Yumoto station and the authentic onsen facilities provide a classic Japanese retreat experience.

This option delivers exceptional value, combining professional-grade facilities with the cherished traditions of Japanese hospitality.

*   **Estimated Budget:** **₩5,640,000 - ₩7,240,000** (average of approx. **₩6,440,000**).
